# Unity Scripts
In here you will find some scripts that were written by me when working on the Uppingham 2015 CTP Summer School. These are very useful in many different types of 3d unity game, especially shooters. They are under the GNU V2.0 licence so feel free to change, modify and redistribute, contact me if you need help implementing them. I will be slowly commenting them and debugging them.

## What’s In Here?
In here you will find some Navigation Scripts, Weapon scripts, health scripts spawn scripts, HUD scripts, camera scripts. A lot of them talk to each other so it would make the most sense to drag all of them into your game.

### Weapons
You can find this all in the ‘Weapon and Health Scripts’ folder. This contains a script for making projectile weapons which are very configurable. It also has the mechanism for health of player, enemies and objects like spawn points. There are scripts to resupply and weapons spawn scripts. There is a script that will give the player points if it dies or if the player walks over it and finally the all inclusive HUD.

### Spawn
There is a spawn script. It is in early stages at the moment. But you can decide how long each wave is and how long between waves. as well as the frequency (In Hz) of spawing.

### Camera
This can be used to make a Third person controller.

### Ai Navigation
There is only currently a script for following the player at the moment. But you can configure the behaviour, removing the player/object being followed from the map or damaging health (Needs the health script). Later, an advanced waypoint based AI is going to be written.
